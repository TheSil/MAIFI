# Minesweeper AI Friendly Interface (MAIFI)
MAIFI is an interface specification of AI friendly interface for classic Minesweeper game. This is not an implementation, only specification to which specific Minesweeper implementations can become compliant to.

The specification is currently work in progress (started on 12/02/2018), it is unstable and should not be followed yet. 

# API Format and protocol
All the requests and responses are done in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format. This specification does not prescribe any specific means on how this JSON format is exchanged (transport protocol). For example for desktop applications this can be by Network TCP/IP sockets, or through file, while for Web based application it can be through HTTP requests. This specification assumes that this layer has taken care of corresponding request/response matching and so it deals only with minimal content.

# Specification

TODO.


# MAIFI compliant Minesweeper implementations
Currently there are no compliant implementations.
