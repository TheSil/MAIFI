# Specification version 1.0.0
This version is currently work in progress (started on 12/02/2018), it is unstable and should not be followed (yet).

The specification describes following messages:
- GetGameInfo
- GameInfo
- ActionField
- ActionFieldBatch

## Message schema
Generic JSON schema for MAIFI is shown below.

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/schema#",
  "title": "MAIFI message",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["message"],
  "properties": {
    "message": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Message identifier"
    }    
  }
}
```

Each message has then its own sub schema with it own required fields. TODO - maybe remove the generic schema and include schema for each of the messages (there are not that many).

## GetGameInfo
Request for getting current board state information. For example:


```json
{
    "message": "GetGameInfo"
}
```



## GameInfo
It includes information about board layouat, number of mines as well as individual fields state. Sent as a response to GetGameInfo. 

Example:

```json
{
    "message": "GameInfo",
    "state": "inprogress", 
    "height": 6,
    "width": 6,
    "mines": 8,
    "layout": 
      [
      "  1000",
      "  1000",
      "  1011",
      "  112 ",
      "      ",
      "      "
      ]
}
```

Allowed states are:

- `"inprogress"` - game is running
- `"lost"` - game has finished as lost
- `"won"` - game has finished as won
- `"none"` - there is no game to be provided info about

Allowed field values (characters) are:

- `' '` - empty, not yet revealed field
- `'F'` - user flagged field
- `'X'` - revealed bomb (only for lost games)
- `'N'` - not playable field
- `'0', '1', ...,  '8'` - revealed fields with  number of surrounding mines


## ActionField

Request to perform action on given field.

Example:

```json
{
    "message": "ActionField",
    "action": "reveal",
    "x": 6,
    "y": 7
}
```

Allowed actions are:

- `"reveal"` - reveal given field
- `"flag"` - flags given field
- `"unflag"` - unflag given field

The `"x ` and `"y"` coordinates are 0 based indeces. So for example for height 20 the `"x"` can have a value in 0, 1, ..., 19.

## ActionFieldBatch

Request to perform multiple actions on specified fields.

Example:

```json
{
    "message": "ActionFieldBatch",
    "actions": 
      [
        {
          "action": "reveal",
          "x": 6,
          "y": 7
        },
        {
          "action": "flag",
          "x": 6,
          "y": 8
        }     
      ]
}
```
