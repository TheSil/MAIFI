# Specification version 1.0.0
This version is currently work in progress (started on 12/02/2018), it is unstable and should not be followed (yet).

The specification describes following messages:
- GetGameInfo
- GameInfo
- FlagField
- RevealField

## Message schema
Generic JSON schema for MAIFI is shown.

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/schema#",
  "title": "MAIFI message",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["message"],
  "properties": {
    "message": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Message identifier"
    }
